    <h2>Web Security</h2>

      I would advise a potential client to secure their website by taking use of
      different practices proven to be efficient against security threats. This
      might be to use data sanitization, which ensures that the data accepted by
      the system is in the right format. You can either do this manually or with
      a third-party solution such as the sanitize-HTML package in NodeJS or an
      ORM library for sanitizing SQL-related code. By using a well-known
      third-party application, you can trust that this practice is tested and
      works well. It is wise to check how many downloads the application you
      choose is downloaded weekly. You should also secure authorization and
      authentication to make it hard for unauthorized users to access your
      system. The easiest way to do this is by using an open-standard
      authorization protocol or framework, such as OneLogin or Okta, etc. You
      might also want to use Continuous Deployment/Continuous Integration
      (CD/CI), which helps point out things you might have overlooked in your
      code. CD/CI tools that you can use are GitHub Action, Jenkins, Travis Ci,
      and Circle CI. This is a great way to maintain the reliability of changes
      in your code. Finally, you should implement automatic user timeout to
      protect the customers credentials if they have left their info in the
      browser for a long time. It is important that you make sure that the API
      you are using takes this into consideration. These practices are important
      to use so that your system is secure and reliable.
